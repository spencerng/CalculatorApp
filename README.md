# Calculator App [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spencerng/CalculatorApp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spencerng/CalculatorApp)

A simple calculator app and tutorial to teach the basics of Android development and working with a (poorly-written) preexisting codebase.

This tutorial repository was written for FRC Team 25, Raider Robotix, and a more experienced programmer should be assisting others as needed. 

**Prerequisites**

* Solid foundation of Java and object-oriented programming
* Basic knowledge of XML 
* Understanding of how Android app source files are structured
* Debugging skills
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) with API level 24+
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* Your own GitHub account

**Goals**

* Explore activities, layouts, and manifest files
* Understand basic linear and relative parameters
* Create layouts via XML and programatically
* Continue to develop algorithmic problem-solving skills
* Understand good material design and Android development practices
* Learn to expand and modify an existing codebase

More goals may be added as this repository evolves

To begin, [fork this repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) on GitHub.

Afterward, clone your fork onto your local machine after navigating to your desired directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/CalculatorApp.git
```

Remember to track changed files and commit changes frequently:

```
git add -a
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```

Refer to [these guidelines](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53) when writing commit messages. Keep them short and sweet!

When you're done testing your code and you're sure it works, push it to GitHub (called the remote):

```
git push origin master
```

That's it! Good luck!
